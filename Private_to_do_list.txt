#For transcriptome data:


## raw data: trimmed reads, 2 paired read files & 2 unpaired read files
1. run Centrifuge
2. run eukfinder_short

## assemble fasta
run eukfinder_long

#Issues to solve:

## Eukfinder_short:
1. what if raw data is single fastq (not paired)
2. what if no unpaired files after trimmomatic or after bowtie2 in the preparation step
    --> error, discontinued
3. mhlen for centrifuge: only need it for assembled fasta, should be 100 or higher


## Eukfinder_long:
1. test for PacBio and Nanopore datasets
2. cov, if 10% or 20%, maybe too long for the superlong reads. better to set 2 threshold (one for length, ie, 200bp or 1000 bp, the other for % of length) and then choose one


Note:
--mhlen in both Eukfinder_short and Eukfinder_long
